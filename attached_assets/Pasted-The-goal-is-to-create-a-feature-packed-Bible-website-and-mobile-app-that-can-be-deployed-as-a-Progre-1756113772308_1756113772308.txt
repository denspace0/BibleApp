The goal is to create a feature-packed Bible website and mobile app that can be deployed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), without needing to publish it on official app stores (Google Play, Apple App Store). This approach allows users to install the app directly from the web, making it available across multiple platforms, with the flexibility of a native app but without store restrictions. You can still package the app for Android, but it will be installed directly as a PWA or via sideloading.

Features and Enhancements:

Web-Based PWA (Progressive Web App) Version:

Progressive Web App (PWA): The web app can function as a mobile app by allowing users to install it directly from the website onto their phone or desktop. This eliminates the need for app store distribution while maintaining an app-like experience.

Offline Support: PWAs have the ability to cache data for offline access, ensuring users can still read Bible verses or devotionals even when there is no internet connection.

Push Notifications: Enable notifications for daily Bible verses, reminders, prayer alerts, and community eventsâ€”just like a native app.

Mobile-first UI: The website will be fully responsive and mobile-optimized for a seamless mobile experience.

User Authentication System:

Login options: Google, Microsoft, and Apple login for easy and secure access, as well as email/password login.

Guest access: Allow users to explore the content without creating an account, and then enable them to sign in to save preferences, notes, and history.

Two-factor authentication (2FA): For added security when logging in.

Multilingual Support (Expandable):

English and Tagalog at launch with easy scalability to more languages.

Language toggle: Users can switch between translations with just one click.

Users can download the APK directly from your website and install it manually on their Android devices without needing the Google Play Store.

Backend & Database:

Use a backend like Node.js, Express, or Django for building REST APIs.

For the database, PostgreSQL or MongoDB can be used to store user data, Bible content, prayers, and user-generated content.

GitHub Deployment:

Host the source code on GitHub, and provide detailed deployment and contribution instructions in the README.md.

Continuous integration and deployment via GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
